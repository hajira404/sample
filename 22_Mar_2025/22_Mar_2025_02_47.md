### Project Description:
 **Code Summary:**
The code is a React application entry point. It imports necessary modules and styles, then renders the main `App` component inside a `StrictMode` wrapper to the DOM element with the id 'root'. This setup ensures that the application follows React's best practices and catches potential issues early.

**Statistics:**
- Number of lines: 7
- Number of functions: 0
- Number of classes: 0
- Number of imports: 4
- Number of components rendered: 1 (`App`)
